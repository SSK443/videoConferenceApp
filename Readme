### Project Overview

**Nexmeet** will be a web-based video conferencing application built using the MERN stack. It will be designed as a simple, modern, and secure platform for users to host and join video meetings. The project will be structured like a real-world SaaS product, with features like user authentication, custom meeting rooms, chat, screen sharing, and admin controls.

### Core Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can register and log in with a username/password or a Google account.
    
- **Custom Meeting Rooms:** Admins can create custom meeting links to share with users.
    
- **High-Quality Video/Audio:** Leveraging WebRTC for real-time communication.
    
- **Real-time Chat:** A messaging feature for users within a meeting.
    
- **Screen Sharing:** Users can share their screens with admin permission.
    
- **Meeting Controls:** Mute/unmute, camera on/off, and other controls for users and admins.
    
- **Admin Privileges:** Admins can mute all users, turn off their cameras, and remove them from a meeting.
    
- **Modern UI/UX:** A clean, intuitive, and responsive user interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.
    

### Tech Stack

- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database to store user data, meeting information, and chat messages.
    
- **Express.js:** A back-end web application framework for Node.js to build our RESTful APIs.
    
- **React.js:** A front-end JavaScript library for building the user interface.
    
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment to run our server-side code.
    
- **Socket.IO:** A library for real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server (for chat and signaling).
    
- **WebRTC (PeerJS/Simple-Peer):** A technology that enables peer-to-peer video and audio streaming directly in the browser. We'll use a library to simplify its implementation.
    
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** For secure user authentication.
    
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.
